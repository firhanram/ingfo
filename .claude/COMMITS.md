# Commit rules

All commits follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) spec.
Every commit message is machine-readable and human-scannable.

---

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Rules

- Subject line: 72 characters max
- Subject: sentence case, no period at the end
- Type: lowercase always
- Scope: lowercase, kebab-case
- Body: wrap at 72 characters, explain *why* not *what*
- Footer: used for breaking changes and issue references
- Empty line between subject, body, and footer — always

---

## Types

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature visible to the user |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code change that is not a feat or fix |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests only |
| `docs` | Documentation only — md files, code comments |
| `style` | Formatting, spacing, no logic change |
| `chore` | Build config, project setup, tooling |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

**Rules:**
- `feat` and `fix` appear in the changelog — all others do not
- Never use `feat` for internal refactors even if they "enable" a feature
- Never use `chore` as a catch-all — if it has a real type, use it

---

## Scopes

Scopes map directly to the folder structure in `file-structure.md`.

| Scope | Maps to |
|---|---|
| `models` | `Models/` — any data model file |
| `storage` | `Services/StorageService.swift` |
| `http` | `Services/HTTPClient.swift` |
| `resolver` | `Services/VariableResolver.swift` |
| `importer` | `Services/PostmanImporter.swift` |
| `shell` | `Views/Shell/` |
| `sidebar` | `Views/Sidebar/` |
| `request` | `Views/Request/` |
| `response` | `Views/Response/` |
| `env` | `Views/Environment/` |
| `history` | `Views/History/` |
| `tokens` | `Resources/AppColors`, `AppFonts`, `AppSpacing` |
| `app` | `App/DoksliApp.swift` |
| `tests` | `DoksliTests/` |
| `docs` | `docs/` and `CLAUDE.md` |
| `checklists` | `docs/checklists/` |
| `config` | Xcode project settings, entitlements, `Info.plist` |

Scope is required for all types except `docs` and `chore`.

## Subject line

- Imperative mood — "add", "fix", "remove", not "added", "fixes", "removed"
- Sentence case — first word capitalised, rest lowercase
- No period at the end
- Describes what the commit does, not what you did

```
// ✅ correct
feat(resolver): Add {{var}} substitution with disabled-var skip

// ❌ wrong — past tense
feat(resolver): Added variable substitution

// ❌ wrong — period at end
feat(resolver): Add variable substitution.

// ❌ wrong — vague
feat(resolver): Update resolver

// ❌ wrong — all caps scope
feat(Resolver): Add variable substitution
```

---

## Body

Optional but required when:
- The *why* is not obvious from the subject line
- The commit changes behaviour in a subtle way
- A technical decision was made that future readers need to understand

```
feat(storage): Use atomic write to prevent data corruption

Direct file writes leave a window where the app can crash
mid-write and produce a corrupt or zero-byte JSON file.

Writing to a temp file in the same directory then calling
rename() is atomic on APFS — the file either fully exists
or does not, with no partial state.
```

---

## Footer

### Breaking changes

```
feat(models): Replace body: String with body: RequestBody enum

BREAKING CHANGE: Request.body is now RequestBody enum, not String.
Migrate: .body = "raw string" → .body = .raw("raw string")
```

### Issue references

```
fix(http): Handle URLSession cancellation without crashing

Fixes #42
```

### Reviewer sign-off

After a task is `APPROVED` in the agent workflow, the footer records it:

```
feat(resolver): Add {{var}} substitution with disabled-var skip

Reviewed-by: Agent-2
Checklist: docs/checklists/03-variable-resolver.md
```

---

## Scoping multiple files

If a commit touches files across scopes, use the primary scope.
If truly cross-cutting, omit the scope entirely.

```
// touches models + storage together
feat(storage): Add HistoryEntry persistence with ring buffer

// cross-cutting — no scope
refactor: Extract KVPair into shared type used by Request and Response
```

## What never goes in a commit message

- "WIP" — finish the work, then commit
- "Fix bug" — which bug, how, why
- "Update file" — describe what changed
- "Per review" — describe the actual change made
- "Misc changes" — split into separate commits
- Emoji — not in the subject line

---

## Commit size

One logical change per commit.

```
// ✅ correct — two separate commits
feat(models): Add Request model with all associated enums
test(models): Add encode/decode round-trip for Request

// ❌ wrong — two concerns in one commit
feat(models): Add Request model and tests
```

If you cannot describe a commit in one subject line without using "and",
it should be two commits.
